        On the right are two animations showing a spread of an infection like Covid-19 with an R0 of 2.5 (top) vs. an H1N1-like infection with an R0 of 1.5 (bottom). The difference between the 2 cases is eye-opening: with only 1 more person-to-person infection, within a few days, an entire community of 1000 people will be infected with an R0 of 2.5, while much fewer individuals will be infected with an R0 of 1.5.


        To contain an epidemic, R0 must be brought down to less than 1. This can be done by various methods, including physical separation (social distancing), sanitation, etc. Communities that practice these control methods can reduce the speed of the epidemic as was proven in various countries, such as China and South Korea.



        How is R0 related to the daily infection rate?



        When R0 is 1, meaning, on average, each person transmits the virus to 1 other individual, the number of new daily infections will become constant. This will cause the total number of infections to rise linearly rather than exponentially. A sign that the spread of the epidemic is slowing is the straightening of the curve of the number of new daily infections, and further, turning it from having a convex (upward) to a concave (downward) curvature. The time at which this occurs is the inflection point.



        What you see is Not what you get



        The number of new daily infections is most likely inaccurate. There are several reasons for that, most notably, it reflects only those who were tested because they may have passed the criteria required for testing. In the USA, testing has been increasing over time, and the rise in the daily infections may reflect the increased testing. One other major reason for the inaccuracy is the lag between the time of the transmission occurred and the time result of testing has come back positive. These suggest that in the early phase of an epidemic, the number of new daily infections is markedly under-estimating the true rate, especially with an epidemic that has a fairly high R0 such as Covid-19.  On the other hand, when the rate of infections is slowing down, the number of new daily infections tends to over-estimate the true rate. This suggests that when an inflection point is observed, inflection may already have occurred.
